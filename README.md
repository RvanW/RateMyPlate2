# RateMyPlate2

A simple app that lets you rate plates.. with cookies!
Currently in beta, user can only select one of the dummy plates and rate them.
Ratings are stored in SharedPreferences so will survive.

Users can switch to landscape mode, and the plate will be displayed in the same activity (using fragments).
